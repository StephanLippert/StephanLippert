# **Welllcome to my Git**

Hi, my Name is Stephan. I live in [Hamburg-Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/nJu9nKwEDQLUPqedA).

> I'm new here @ [NeueFische](https://www.neuefische.de/) and after my first two Days i would say...i kind of feel like a small Guppy swimming in a big Pond full of Sharks...![Hamm!](https://get.wallhere.com/photo/illustration-shark-fish-blue-underwater-Pixar-Animation-Studios-Disney-Pixar-biology-Finding-Nemo-screenshot-computer-wallpaper-marine-biology-cartilaginous-fish-178536.jpg)...But i think i can learn a lot at the Bootcamp and i hope that at least i'll become a much bigger Guppy xD

**S**ince i was a Kid, In spent my Freetime with playing Pc & ConsoleGames. I also found a stong connection to HipHopMusic, so i try myselfe a little bit in producing Beatz an writing Songtexes.
